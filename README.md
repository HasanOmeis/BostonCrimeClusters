# BostonCrimeClusters
By applying Unsupervised ML algorithm (Clustering) to a dataset of Boston Crimes reported (17 features), I was able to create a model using 3 different methods (K-means, KNN, Hierarchical clustering). 
This model is capable of predicting Crimes before happening using many features (day, hour, location, offence code...).
